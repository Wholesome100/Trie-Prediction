# TriePrediction
This was a university project for Data Structures, the specifics of which are detailed in TriePrediction.pdf

Please, do not copy this code to complete assignments. Logical observation is welcome, but copying will not instill the necessary skills and confidence to succeed.

# Running the Code
Clone the repository into your preferred development environment. The code is intended to be run from the command line, but I used Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC Compiler)

With Visual Studio, open the .sln file. In the project directory, corpus07 and input07 are included, with the remaining test cases and inputs in test_cases. These arguments are meant to be provided at the command line, which can be done by specifying them in the debugging section of the project properties.
The preprocessor directive _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS will also need to be specified.

The other test cases will need to be included/excluded as desired due to the project requirements. (The corpus/input file design was intended for a linux system used for grading.) The ouput for each corpus and input can be checked against their respective output file.
